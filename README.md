### Oh-My-Posh Customizations Repository

This repository will contain my personal attempts attempts
constructing a configuration and theme that meets my 
preferences.   

#### Intitial Goals:

- Identify some quiality themes included with Oh-My-Posh
  and experiment a little with them to gain basic 
  understanding of how the configuration options work
- Once I have been able to successful modify some 
  existing themes, then I will explore the capablities
  of the theme system in genreal, so I will understanding
  what can be done which will allow me to decide what I
  would like to achieve in a theme I design from scratch
- Design a theme from scratch
- Design a second theme, using what I leard from the 1st
  theme I made to increase the quality/function
  of the 2nd theme
- Decide if I need/want to go any further with the omp
  themes & configurations or if I feel I have already
  created a theme that I like so I don't feel a need
  or desire to explore the system further
  
#### Stock Oh-My-Posh Themes I may want to play with:

1. atomic
2. atomicBit
3. clean-detailed
4. devious-diamonds
5. night-owl
6. quick-term
7. wholespace

The above themes seem to be good looking, although some 
of the colors could be adjusted on some of them, and they 
will also allow me to explore how most of the functions 
I am interested in using for my personal configuration 
work.  

#### My 1st Modified Theme:
